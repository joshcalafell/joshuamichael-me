            <p>I am a conscientious and resourceful software developer focusing on front end technologies. I have a
              can-do attitude, an eye for design, and can assess an organization‚Äôs needs and work to create
              complementary and robust web and mobile applications.</p>
            <p>I believe firmly in DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) and
              KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles. I always strive to compose potent, reusable, and minimalist code,
              while implementing practical design patterns. I also study communication, both interpersonal and
              organizational, and am a firm believer in the power of ‚Äúgood‚Äù communication, trust, and teamwork. </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I‚Äôm a musician, synthesizer geek, cyclist (I‚Äôm currently learning bicycle maintenance),
              and writer. I‚Äôm also an avid film buff and I love board games and RPGs.
              I have been involved in Greyhound rescue for 10+ years.</p>
            <p>I was born
              in Evergreen, CO, but lived in Denver, CO for most of my life until I relocated to Spokane Valley, WA this
              last year with my partner and our greyhound Raven to start a new life together in the inland
              Northwest.
